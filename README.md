# Inferential_Business_Statistics_Project
This is my project for Module 2 the Data Science and Business Analytics course at UT-Austin's McCombs Business School.

PROJECT PROMPT:

Context - Leveraging customer information is of paramount importance for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, the attributes of customers like the ones mentioned below can be crucial in making business decisions. Hence, knowing to explore and generate value out of such data can be an invaluable skill to have.

Objective – Statistical Analysis of Business Data. Explore the dataset and extract insights from the data. The idea is for you to get comfortable with doing statistical analysis in Python.

You are expected to do the following:

Explore the dataset and extract insights using Exploratory Data Analysis.
Prove (or disprove) that the medical claims made by the people who smoke is greater than those who don't? [Hint- Formulate a hypothesis and prove/disprove it]
Prove (or disprove) with statistical evidence that the BMI of females is different from that of males.
Is the proportion of smokers significantly different across different regions? [Hint : Create a contingency table/cross tab, Use the function : stats.chi2_contingency()]
Is the mean BMI of women with no children, one child, and two children the same? Explain your answer with statistical evidence.
*Consider a significance level of 0.05 for all tests.

Data Dictionary –

Age - This is an integer indicating the age of the primary beneficiary (excluding those above 64 years, since they are generally covered by the government).
Sex - This is the policy holder's gender, either male or female.
BMI - This is the body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over or underweight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
Children - This is an integer indicating the number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
Smoker - This is yes or no depending on whether the insured regularly smokes tobacco.
Region - This is the beneficiary's place of residence in the U.S., divided into four geographic regions - northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest.
Charges - Individual medical costs billed to health insurance
Best Practices for Notebook : 

The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.
It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb) 
Best Practices for Presentation :

The presentation should be made keeping in mind that the audience will be a business leader like CMO, COO, CFO, or CEO.
The key points in the presentation should be the following
business overview of the problem and solution approach
key findings and insights which are important to make business decisions
key conclusions made on the basis of the statistical analysis
Focus on explaining the takeaways in an easy-to-understand manner.
Copying and pasting from the notebook is not a good idea, and it is better to avoid showing codes unless they are the focal point of your presentation.
The presentation should be submitted as a PDF file (.pdf) and NOT as a .pptx file.
Submission Guidelines:

Please note the following:

There are two parts to the submission: 
A well commented Jupyter notebook [format - .html]
A presentation as you would present to the top management/business leaders [format - .pdf ] (you have to export/save the .pptx file as .pdf)
Any assignment found copied/ plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and awarded zero marks
Please ensure timely submission as a post-deadline assignment will not be accepted
Submission will not be evaluated if,
it is submitted post-deadline, or,
more than 2 files are submitted

GRADE:  I earned 59 out of 60 points on this project.
